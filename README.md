### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cole D, or dylcdav

I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer most familiar with the MERN stack, though I'm currently getting to know Django and Vue.js. I recently completed FullStack Open 2023, and my current major project is a website to analyze the bikability of various locations. If you want to learn more, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylcdav/) profile, or some of the projects I've worked on below.
